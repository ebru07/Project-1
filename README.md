## Project-1-College Recruitment Improvement Study
This project aims to explore student data on provided survey data to help the CCM Department of Information Technologies increase the representation of under-represented groups in computing classes. In this project, data was cleaned, analyzed and put in graphs to answer the following questions about students who chose computing majors: 

1. From those who answered likely to take another computing class(4 or 5) what is the distribution of the majors/departments they are enrolled as?
2. What are the demographic distribution of the data?(Age, Race/Ethinicity, Gender)
3. What percent of students were engaged with CCM(attended an event at CCM) prior to enrolling to CCM?
4. What percent of students received information about the computing programs/classes at CCM? What is the top information source?
5. What percent of students chose a computing major/certification as their first major? What are the distributions of previous CCM programs for those who changed to a computing major/certification?

This repository contains the cleaned CSV file, a jupyter notebook(python) dedicated to cleaning the original dataset, and a jupyter notebook(python) dedicated to analyzing the cleaned CSV file.
