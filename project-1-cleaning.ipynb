    "1. From those who answered likely to take another computing class(4 or 5) what is the distribution of the majors/departments they are enrolled as?\n",

    "2. What are the demographic distribution of the data?(Age, Race/Ethinicity, Gender)\n",

So I got helped from chatGPT with how to most affectively clean this data. I will attach a word document with the prompt I gave chatGPT and the response it printed out. How it approached it was by using mapping and creating a new column in the dataset to store the cleaned(renamed) rows. I overwrite the old column to avoid adding more columns to my dataset."
